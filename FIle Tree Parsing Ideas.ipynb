    "# 4. Using Third-Party Libraries:\n",
    "There are third-party libraries like oset or treelib that provide data structures specifically designed for representing file trees.\n",

    "## Pros:\n",
    "\n",
    "Simplicity: These libraries offer convenient and straightforward ways to represent file trees without the need for custom implementations.\n",
    "Additional Features: Some libraries provide additional functionality like tree traversal, manipulation, or serialization.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Cons:\n",
    "\n",
    "Dependency: Using a third-party library introduces an external dependency to your project.\n",
    "Learning Curve: You'll need to learn the API and usage patterns of the chosen library.\n",
    "\n",
    "##Recommendation:\n",
    "For a simple and memory-efficient representation, the list-based approach is a good choice. If you require a true hierarchical representation and don't mind the added complexity, the custom tree data structure approach is ideal. For more advanced use cases or when you want to avoid custom implementations, consider using third-party libraries."
